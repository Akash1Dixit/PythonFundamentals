# Python program
# to count numbers
# satisfying equation.

# function that returns sum of
# digits in a number
def sum(n):

	rem = 0

	#initially sum of digits is 0
	sum_of_digits = 0

	# loop runs till all digits
	# have been extracted
	while (n > 0):
	
		# last digit from backside
		rem = n % 10

		# sums up the digits
		sum_of_digits += rem

		# the number is reduced to the
		# number removing the last digit
		n = n // 10

	# returns the sum
	# of digits in a number
	return sum_of_digits

# function to calculate
# the count of
# such occurrences
def count(n):

	# counter to calculate the occurrences
	c = 0

	# loop to traverse from n - 97 to n
	for i in range(n - 97,n+1):

		# calls the function to calculate
		# the sum of digits of i
		a = sum(i)

		# calls the function to calculate
		# the sum of digits of a
		b = sum(a)

		# if the summation is equal to n
		# then increase counter by 1
		if ((i + a + b) == n):

	# returns the count
